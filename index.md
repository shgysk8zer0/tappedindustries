## GPS ear tag solutions for remote locations.

Searching for a cost-effective method to track your livestock that is both time-efficient
and friendly towards the environment? Need to track your livestock in places without
reliable internet? We are here to help!

Our company utilizes solar-powered ear tag trackers that use a combination of
satellite and state-of-the-art radio technology to provide locations of livestock.
The combination of satellite and radio technology allows farmers and ranchers to
track their livestock from the comfort of their home at affordable prices, even
in places where the internet may be hard to access. All that is required are ear
tag trackers that are the size of traditional ear tags and a radio antenna, which
we set up for you. We believe there are many farms and ranches out there that
are ready to make the leap into new technology to help better their operations,
but they simply just do not know where to start.

Thatâ€™s why here at Tapped Industries LLC, we provide a full service, from consultation,
to installation, to training how to use the tracking software. For more information,
